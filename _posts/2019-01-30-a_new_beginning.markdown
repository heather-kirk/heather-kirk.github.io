Did I want to go back to school? Nope. 

I'm 32 and thought studying was a thing of my past unless I was learning some new inititative at work. However, at my current job, I have felt unchallenged and left without a purpose which is what led me to all you fine people today.

You see, I graduated with a BFA in Digital Media. Upon graduation, I was disappointed that my school only taught HTML/CSS. Requirements of even being at an entry level called upon learning other languages, ones that I wasn't exposed to in the slightest. I thought in vain, that perhaps I didn't have to learn another language, that perhaps a 40 hour a week job would fulfill me. I just wanted money, right? Dream jobs weren't a thing. It was all just the Monday-Friday grind in the end. However, I quickly became to realize it wasn't. Even as I moved up the corporate ladder, I felt something was missing even though some of my close friends and my significant other are employed there.

Looking inward, I tried to find a fulfilling career track for me. All these paths floated around my head, until I thought about what would be best for me. My personality, how I like to work, etc. I kept going back to technology and how frustrated I'd get from coding HTML/CSS. Those "aha!" moments were remarkable. Never had I felt so punished and yet so rewarded when I realized it was just the simplest thing or even a complex idea that I needed to wrap my head around, stop thinking so inside the box. That was then I realized I honestly missed coding and began my research. 

Not being able to quit my job to do a cohort in person, I had to venture into looking on-line. Oh man, there are countless of programs out there and all promising the same thing so sifting through programs, what languages they offered and the demand of those languages out here, plus how they differed from other schools seemed like a daunting task at first. With patience, I widdled around ones that fit me the best until I made calls to my top 3 requesting more information. 

Flatiron to me seemed like the best fit. It's week 3 and there are numerous resources here at your disposal. It's challenging but immersive, and I'm fully confident that when my co-hort ends, I'll be able to venture into the job market confident that not only did I make the right choice, but I have the skillset in order to be a valuable member of a team.
