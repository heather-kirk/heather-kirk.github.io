For my first project, we were to create an interactive CLI gem. For most of the project, I was deadset on travel. The wanderlust part of me was craving to find out new places to potentially travel to and all in all, it seemed like a fun project until I got to the scraping. Either the websites had novice HTML that either made it hard to scrape or a robust website like National Geographic that had Javascript running on the main page, and well, Nokogiri and Javascript don't go hand in hand. 

Time was running out as far as the deadline went and every travel website was yielding fruitless results so I turned to the aid of one of the instructors for advice. I wound up revamping the project Saturday and switched gears to focus on Harry Potter. More specifically, Harry Potter illustrated editions from Bloomsbury. 

While most of my time was spent scraping, I learned a lot about how objects interact with each other. It's hard to wrap your mind around how a word can be an object and can refer to its self and to think outside the box. Once you can grasp that and well, I'm still learning, it's much easier to comprehend Ruby's concepts and to code freely. 

Ideally, I would like to make a more robust CLI in the future now that I'm aware of a scraper from one of the professors that makes picking a website much more simple. If you're curious in my latest project, check out my github link at : https://github.com/heather-kirk/harry_potter_cli. 

Will write back again soon!
