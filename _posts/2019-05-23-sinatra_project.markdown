I decided on a custom coffee order based on how you like your coffee to taste and how often you like to drink it. Wanting to employ "tongue-in-cheek" grammar for millenials, I created a website that millenials would be interested in with my choice in language and looked up a coffee color palette to fit the theme. This was definitely a challenging but rewarding project. 

One of the challenges I had was understanding and grasping fully 'get' and 'post' requests. For some reason, I had them backwards. In all actuality, 'get' requests get the information from the user and 'post' requests posts them to our database and saves it. It took me admittedly some time to get used to booting up shotgun to ensure that all my links were working correctly. 

It wasn't until I started doing so, that I began to understand the concepts of storing and submitting data to a website. While my website would still be easily hackable, I am quite proud that about learning about crucial concepts such as sessions vs cookies and checking to see if a user is logged in before them accessing other pages.

At first, I wanted to do b2b company that relied on company's analytics in order to help them drive traffic through Google. After trying to sketch out how that would happen, I was at a loss because I felt I was missing some crucial concepts in order to make a much more sophisticated website. Perhaps for Rails or Javascript, I could attempt that idea again. 

While I was designing the website, I noticed I am definitely rusty with HTML/CSS. Even though beautiful code in that aspect wasn't necessary, I experience a lot of "code smell" with my selectors. I probably could have grouped them up more in order to make cleaner code in hindsight. In fact, as I familiarize myself more with code I would love to go back and make this more sophisticated. 

Not all pages are finished either. I tried to be robust, but time and life got in the way and the pages that didn't matter such as an "about" page got left behind in me submitting the project. Those pages are also something else I'd like to design and adding in more UX elements that allow for a better user experience with this page such as the buttons be highlighted and overall a more sophisticated login system that you see where it's a drop down menu as opposed to be fixated.

While I go between feelings of feeling completely inept and "aha!" moments with code, I am assured that's normal because there's still so much to learn and that's the beauty of it all.
